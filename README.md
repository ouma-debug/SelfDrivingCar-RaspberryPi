# SelfDrivingCar-RaspberryPi
Prototype about a self driving car using Raspberry pi 4 and Lane detection algorithm
In this project you'll find two versions of code: One where the raspberry pi's camera is working fine. One where the camera wasn't working and so we had to use our laptop’s camera 
and so what we did was using the camera on our laptop and send the video to the raspberry pi, process it with lane detection’s algorithm,  and send back to the raspberry pi the 
instructions to control and move the car’s kit. All this was in real time operating and the connection between the raspberry pi and our laptop was done by Socket.

What you would need:
  Car’s kit ( example https://www.amazon.com/perseids-Chassis-Encoder-Wheels-Battery/dp/B07DNYQ3PX)
  Battery
  Motor driver L298N
  Raspberry pi 4
  Raspberry pi’s camera (the first case)
  Ultrasonic sensor hc-sr04
  Battery for the raspberry pi (optional but you need an alimentation to the raspberry pi)
Software: 
OpenCv
Python
Socket (the second case)
